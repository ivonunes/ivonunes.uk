There’s a certain tension that builds up when I haven’t made something in a while. It's not always loud, but it's always there – that feeling that something wants to get out.

It doesn't always take the same form. It could be a tool that solves a problem, a random idea I had for a game, or anything in between. The important thing is the act of creating. Making something new. Bringing order to the chaos in my head.

I used to see this as a choice, but I've come to realise it's more of a constant. It's simply wired into how I think and process the world around me. When I’m building, things make more sense. I feel clearer. More grounded. The most painful thing, for me, is sitting still. Not just physically, but mentally. When there's nothing to explore, no problem to solve, no thread to follow. 

Not everything needs to be shared or to succeed. Sometimes it's enough just to start. Follow that urge and see where it leads. If it fails, that’s fine. I can live with a bad idea — I just can’t live with not even trying.

This post is that, in a way. A small thing, made because the urge to create was stronger than the ease of ignoring it.
