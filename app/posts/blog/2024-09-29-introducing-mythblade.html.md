<p>This has been a long time in the making, but today I’m ready to unveil a little project I’ve been working on.</p>
<p>Building video games is hard. Building an MMORPG? That’s the hardest genre you could possibly build.</p>
<p>Most game developers would tell you building an MMORPG alone is a terrible idea. And they’d be absolutely right. The content, the interconnected systems, the networking, the server management, the endless balancing, the list goes on and on. But here I am, ignoring all common sense, and doing it anyway. Even if it is a bit mad.</p>
<p>Mythblade is mostly text-based, and is very much modelled after retro RPGs. It is playable across a range of devices, including mobile phones. And it is incredibly fun, if I may say so myself.</p>
<p>After countless nights of iteration after iteration, and incorporating some fantastic feedback from a small group of alpha testers, I’m pretty happy with the state of the game. And I’m ready to start accepting beta testers over at <a href="https://www.mythblade.com">https://www.mythblade.com</a>.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot to do. There might some bumps along the way, but if you’re curious about how it all unfolds, feel free to join me for the ride.</p>
