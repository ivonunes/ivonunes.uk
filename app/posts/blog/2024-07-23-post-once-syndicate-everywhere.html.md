<p>As a long-time fan of the POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) model, I've always believed in maintaining control over my content. However, I've never been good at the second part: making sure my content reaches as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks I've done a major rebuild of my personal website, and I used it as an opportunity to try and tackle this problem.</p>
<p>Now, when I publish a new post or photo, many things happen in the background and my content is automatically sent to all corners of the Internet.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of content, there's a few different actions that might happen:<br>
- A post is created on LinkedIn or Bluesky.<br>
- An email is sent out to my website subscribers.<br>
- A photo is submitted to Flickr.<br>
- A post gets sent out to all my fediverse followers.</p>
<p>And I'm sure this list will grow as time passes.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is my first real world test. If you're reading this, chances are it worked. Probably.</p>
