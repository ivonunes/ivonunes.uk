A little under a year ago I [shared](https://ivonunes.uk/2024/09/29/introducing-mythblade/) a little game I was working on called Mythblade.

At the time I was still figuring out its direction as a closed beta. It was most definitely still a bit rough around the edges. Nevertheless, I gathered quite the group of enthusiastic beta testers. Their feedback was really valuable and I kept, over and over again, iterating over the game design. A huge thank you to everyone involved, this wouldn't have been possible without you.

Today, I'm launching the full version of the game. I'm quite happy with how the game's evolved over the last year. It's now open to everyone, so if you feel like joining the adventure, head over to [Mythblade](https://www.mythblade.com) and give it a try.
