<p>It's been a long time since I've had my own blog. Too long, in fact. In a world ruled by social media, it's easy to let go of owning your own little corner of the Internet.</p>
<p>I'll start with a quick introduction:</p>
<p>I'm Ivo. I'm a software engineer at heart, with a passion for building great products. I'm also known by some as having a particular weakness for guitars.</p>
<p>I enjoy a good technical challenge, and will in the future be sharing some of my learnings with you.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
